## The Influence of Effect Placement on Generalised Linear Model Outputs

### Tutorial aims
- Understand How Fixed and Random Effects Placement Changes Your Model
- Understand How Adding or Multiplying Effects Changes Your Model
- Decide When to Use Which Effect Placement and Whether to Multiply or Add
- Model Building and Performance Comparison through Result Interpretation
- When and how should variables be scaled

### Tutorial pre-requisites
- A basic knowledge of data wrangling
- How to code Generalised Linear Models and Generalised Linear Mixed Models

### Introduction
Hello Linear Modellers! Welcome to this tutorial on how and why the placement of effects within your Generalised Linear (Mixed) Models influences the outputs of your models, what the outputs mean and in what scenario you should use each one. 
In this tutorial, we will use a dataset on meat consumption through time to examine how to account for variation in consumption across countries and subjects (eg, beef, poultry, etc.) within our model, and in what cases we would use each iteration of the model.
It is important to highlight that when modelling data, you should not try out different models and choose the one that best fits your data, as this leads to P-Hacking. However, in this tutorial, we are trying and testing the effects of the different models to demonstrate what each one means, their outputs, and in what scenarios you would choose each one.
